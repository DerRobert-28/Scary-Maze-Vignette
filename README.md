<br>

## Features:

* This resource pack shows the face of the famous Scary Maze Game in the Nether as a vignette.

* It should be compatible to all Minecraft versions containing the Nether dimension.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

* [Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC](https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

* Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your `resourcepacks` folder:

  - for Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

  - for Linux: `~\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

* **IMPORTANT:**

  - If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your `resourcepacks` folder, it will **NOT** work.
  
  - If you extract all files and copy the extracted `resourcepacks` folder, it may also **NOT** work.
  
<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
